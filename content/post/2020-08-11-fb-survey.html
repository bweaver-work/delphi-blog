<p>In collaboration with Facebook, along with a consortium of universities and
public health officials, we’ve been conducting surveys since April 2020 to
monitor the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Our
survey, advertised through Facebook, gets about 74,000 responses every day.
Respondents provide information about COVID-related symptoms, contacts, risk
factors, and demographics, allowing us to examine county-level trends across the
US. We believe such a combination of <em>detail</em> and <em>scale</em> has never before been
available in a public health emergency. In this post, we’ll explore some of our
initial survey findings, show how you can get access to the data, and highlight
some exciting new directions we’re now pursuing.</p>

<p><strong>Credits.</strong> <em>Logan Brooks and Katie Mazaitis wrote the initial code for
processing the survey data and producing estimates. Taylor Arnold and Alex
Reinhart provided huge help with refactoring and improving this codebase. Logan
Brooks, Pratik Patil, Rob Tibshirani, and Ryan Tibshirani developed the
statistical methodology behind the estimates computed from the survey data. The
COVIDcast API, which serves these estimates and is updated daily, is a much
larger effort run by the Delphi group; and our entire engineering team is owed a
lot of credit here. Ryan Tibshirani came up with the idea of running the
surveys, and worked with Facebook to make this a reality. On the Facebook side,
Curtiss Cobb and Jonathan McKay played big roles.</em></p>
<p>In collaboration with Facebook, along with a consortium of universities and
public health officials, we’ve been conducting surveys since April 2020 to
monitor the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Our
survey is advertised through Facebook, but it’s run on our own Qualtrics
platform (Facebook never sees any of the survey responses). This is an ongoing
operation and our survey gets about 74,000 responses every day. We believe that
such a combination of <em>detail</em> and <em>scale</em> has never before been available via
surveys in a public health emergency: we collect info on COVID-related symptoms,
contacts, risk factors, and demographics, enabling us to look at county-level
trends across the US. We make aggregated data publicly available daily through
our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">COVIDcast
API</a>, and
visualize it on our <a href="https://covidcast.cmu.edu/">COVIDcast interactive map</a>. We
also make (fully de-identified) individual survey responses available to
researchers who agree to <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">data use
terms</a>.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore some of our initial findings with two
COVID-like illness indicators that are derived from our surveys. In terms of
what these surveys have to offer, this is really just the tip of the iceberg …
and we’ll highlight some other exciting directions that we’re pursuing now.</p>

<h2>Short Background</h2>
<p>Back in March 2020, we began discussions with Facebook about the idea of running
a survey, advertised through their site, to collect real-time, county-level
information on people experiencing COVID-like symptoms. The basic premise was
that we could use this information to construct a leading indicator of COVID
activity in the US. We certainly weren’t the first group to think of running
COVID-19 symptom surveys: many groups before us had already deployed such
surveys (like <a href="https://covidnearyou.org/">Covid Near You</a>, <a href="https://covid.joinzoe.com/us-2">COVID Symptom
Study</a>, etc.). But we sought to build a survey
that could (a) grow to be truly massive in size and (b) be sustained at this
size, something we felt was only possible with buy-in from a platform like
Facebook. Fortunately for us, they agreed!</p>
<p>We launched our survey on April 6, 2020. Each day since then, Facebook directs a
random sample of its users each day to our survey, hosted on
<a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>. As part of our agreement with Facebook,
we receive the data directly from Qualtrics, and Facebook never sees any of the
survey responses. We use the data only for research purposes, and only
aggregated data is ever released publicly. As of this writing, our survey
receives an average of over 74,000 responses per day; delivers adequate data
(enough for us to create meaningful estimates) for an average of nearly 1000
counties per week; and has been taken over 9.5 million times so far. An
<a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/">international version of the survey</a>, available in
over 50 languages, was launched soon after by a team at the University of
Maryland.</p>
<p>We’ll go into detail later about on our survey and our survey-based indicators,
but for now, here’s a couple quick maps. On the left is a state-level heatmap of
the estimated percentage of people with COVID symptoms, based on our survey,
averaged over June 15 to July 15. On the right is a heatmap of the number of
daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, based on data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">JHU
CSSE</a>, averaged over the same
period. We can see some clear similarities in the intensity patterns, which is
certainly a good sanity-check.</p>

<div id="why-run-these-surveys" class="section level2">
<h2>Why Run These Surveys?</h2>
<p>Now let’s unpack the main motivation behind our survey a bit: a person typically
experiences COVID-like symptoms before they seek medical care or a COVID-19
test, so data on how many people are self-reporting COVID-like symptoms in a
given county could be used to construct a <strong>leading indicator</strong> of COVID
activity in that county. And to be clear, it’s not just the fact that we’re
looking at symptoms that’s important here, it’s the <em>way</em> we’re measuring them:
since self-reporting symptoms can be done from home, with no special equipment
needed, the data here wouldn’t be subject to the same reporting delays as formal
testing metrics like confirmed COVID-19 case counts.</p>
<p>(Aside from being delayed, confirmed COVID-19 case counts are actually further
confounded by issues like testing policy and capacity; and self-reported symptom
data shouldn’t be subject to the same problems. This is a potentially very
important point, but much more subtle, and we won’t delve into it on this post.)</p>
<p>It’s also worth being very clear about what we’re <em>not</em> able to say with these
surveys:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symptoms alone are not sufficient to diagnose coronavirus infections: of
course, COVID-like symptoms can be caused by other conditions, and many true
infections are asymptomatic. Therefore, even if we ignore the issues brought on
by self-reporting and survey sampling, we can’t expect the estimates we produce
to be reflective of the true rate of COVID-19 (and they’re not intended to be).</p></li>
<li><p>Our survey responses come from the population of Facebook users in the US,
which may a sizeable fraction of the US population, but certainly not all of it.
We’ll also likely see survey bias because some people on Facebook are more
inclined to take surveys than others. We attempt to correct for both of these
biases using a <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html#survey-weighting">statistical reweighting
scheme</a>),
but these corrections aren’t perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Our symptom data is entirely self-reported (as opposed to, for example, being
reported by a medical professional). Some fraction of the responses could be
erroneous, either because a person misunderstood the question or chose to answer
incorrectly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, our survey data can’t be used to make absolute statements about
the true prevalence of coronavirus disease in the US; in fact, it shouldn’t even
be regarded as a foolproof way of deriving unbiased estimates of the number of
people with COVID-19 <em>symptoms</em> in the US (mainly due to the self-reporting
aspect). Nevertheless, as we’ll see evidence of below, <em>changes in self-reported
symptoms over time</em> can still be a meaningful reflection of the changes in
coronavirus infections over time. (And in the best case, it’ll be a reflection
of changes to come some number of days into the future.)</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-on-the-survey" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s on the Survey?</h2>
<p>Our survey has 4 sections and is about 35 questions long. The first section is
short and gathers info on a core set of symptoms used to define a condition
called <strong>COVID-like illness</strong> or <strong>CLI</strong>, which we define as <em>fever of at least
100 °F, along with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing</em>. This
mirrors the standard definition of influenza-like illness or ILI (defined as
fever of at least 100 °F, along with sore throat or cough), and is in line with
the working definition of CLI used by the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Using data from responses to the survey’s first section, we can compute
estimates of two key quantities, in a given location, on a given day:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>% CLI: the percentage of people with COVID-like illness; and</p></li>
<li><p>% CLI-in-community: the percentage of people who <em>know someone in their local
community</em> with COVID-like illness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Details on how we compute the % CLI and % CLI-in-community estimates can be
found in our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html">COVIDcast signals
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The % CLI-in-community indicator has an interesting backstory: it was sort of a
“happy accident” of an experiment we tried with surveys we were running in
partnership with Google. (We’ll cover our Google survey in a future blog post.)
The preliminary results from this experiment were exciting enough that we
decided to add a similar question to our Facebook survey about a week after its
initial launch.</p>
<p>The second section of the survey goes into more detail on symptoms, testing, and
medical-seeking behavior. The third section gathers info on contacts and risk
factors, and the fourth section gathers info on demographics. These survey
questions, taken altogether, provide a wealth of information that we haven’t
fully tapped into (but plan to soon—see the end of this blog post). To give
credit where it’s due: it was Facebook who initially suggested we run a longer
survey with extensive questions on contacts, risk factors, and demographics. At
first, we wanted to run a short survey with only the questions on COVID-like
illness, and Facebook gathered ideas for more questions from several different
research groups in public health. They assured us that lengthening the survey
wouldn’t hurt the the completion rate too much, and they were right: of the
people who complete the first section, over 85% go on to finish the full survey!</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/">survey documentation
site</a> includes more
details about the survey, including the <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html">full text of every survey
version</a>.
And yes, researchers can <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">request
access</a>
to (fully de-identified) individual survey responses for research purposes.</p>

<div id="some-interesting-examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Some Interesting Examples</h2>
<p>Now we’ll turn to some interesting data examples which serve as evidence that
our survey-based CLI signals can be early indicators of COVID activity. We’ll
consider the % CLI-in-community indicator in particular, which tends to be more
stable than the % CLI indicator (roughly similar, albeit noisier trends would
show up in the % CLI indicator). Let’s start by looking at Miami-Dade County,
which experienced a surge of new COVID-19 cases between June and July: below we
plot daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases over time (using a 7-day trailing
average for smoothing) as a blue curve. We also plot the % CLI-in-community
indicator as a red curve. Note that these two curves, case counts and %
CLI-in-community, are not measured in the same units, hence our use of two
y-axes: one on the left for case counts, and one on the right for %
CLI-in-community.</p>

<p>(This example, as with all code examples in this blog post, was produced using
our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/">covidcast R package</a>.)</p>
<p>A first glance reveals that the % CLI-in-community indicator clearly rises
alongside confirmed COVID-19 cases, a reassuring sanity-check (more people
indeed report that others are sick in their community, at a time when COVID-19
tests confirm more cases). But a closer look shows something quite interesting:
the % CLI-in-community signal begins to rise steeply on June 19 (first dashed
vertical line), which <em>happens 6 days before</em> COVID-19 cases begin their steep
ascent on June 25 (second dashed vertical line).</p>
<p>This is just one county; to investigate further, we pulled the 20 counties with
the biggest increase in new COVID-19 cases between June 1 and July 15, and
produced analogous plots below, with COVID-19 cases in red and the %
CLI-in-community indicator in blue. We can see that the % CLI-in-community
indicator is (a) never lagging and (b) again leading in many counties, for
example, Dallas County, Orange County, Hidalgo County, and Nueces County are a
few notable examples.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>num = 20
geo_values = df_in_cty %&gt;% group_by(geo_value) %&gt;% 
  summarize(diff = last(value) - first(value)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(diff)) %&gt;% head(num) %&gt;% pull(geo_value) 

p_list = vector(&quot;list&quot;, num)
for (i in 1:num) {
  p_list[[i]] = plot_one_cty(geo_values[i], legend = FALSE)
}

<p><img src="/blog/post/2020-08-11-fb-survey_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg" width="960" /></p>
<p>The examples above are an informal way of looking at the <em>recall</em> of the %
CLI-in-community signal. Of course, this is only one half of the story: for the
signal to be a useful early indicator, we’d also need to know something about
its <em>precision</em>: we’d need to know that % CLI-in-community seldomly rises in
periods where new COVID-19 cases remain flat. We’ll save a formal
precision-recall analysis for future work.</p>

<h2>What’s Next with the Surveys</h2>
<p>You might expect that a survey that reaches tens of thousands of respondents
within the US daily—and has done so for months during a major pandemic—could
have <em>many</em> possible uses beyond simply surveying symptoms. You would be
right. As we explain above, beyond the first section of our survey there
are many questions on testing, behavior, medical care, mental health, and
related topics, leading to a multitude of possible research questions.</p>
<p>This is why Delphi and the University of Maryland (for the international
version) offer direct access to the survey data to academic and non-profit
researchers, who agree to data use terms (requiring, for one, that researchers
don’t attempt to identify respondents and don’t release individual survey
responses, only averages and other aggregates). So far, over a dozen research
groups have access to our survey data, and are using it to study various aspects
of the pandemic. We’re actively seeking researchers studying important public
health problems to apply for access through a <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">form managed by
Facebook</a>,
and our goal is to build a network of researchers committed to fighting the
pandemic through our survey data.</p>
<p>To aid this effort, we’re soon releasing a new version of the survey. Based on
feedback from other researchers, public health agencies, the University of
Maryland, and Facebook, we’ve added items asking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>more details on COVID testing (including whether the respondent tried to get a
test but could not);</li>
<li>mask wearing;</li>
<li>the types of activities the respondent has done with other people;</li>
<li>mental health and social isolation;</li>
<li>employment;</li>
<li>more details on demographics (including race and education).</li>
</ul>
<p>These items will give us an unprecedented view into how people have responded to
the pandemic, how they have been affected by the pandemic and the resulting
economic downturn, and how specific groups are affected. We hope the mask and
behavior items can help researchers studying how best to prevent the spread of
COVID-19, and can even help inform forecasts, while mental health and isolation
items will help researchers understand how social distancing and recession have
affected mental health. Together with extended demographic data, this may help
inform policies designed to help those most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>This new survey is currently being deployed, and data should become available
in the next few weeks. Detailed data will be available to researchers, while new
aggregates—such as of mask-wearing—will be made public, as usual, through
our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">COVIDcast
API</a> and
<a href="https://covidcast.cmu.edu/">COVIDcast interactive map</a>.</p>

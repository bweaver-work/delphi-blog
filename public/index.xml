      <description>In March 2020, the Delphi group at Carnegie Mellon University launched the COVIDcast project, a comprehensive effort to:
 build and maintain new data streams and indicators that reflect COVID-19 activity and burden, make that data available to researchers, journalists, and the public through a public API and packages for R and Python, build interactive maps and graphics to inform decision makers and the public, and develop forecasts of the future spread of the pandemic and healthcare demand.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hello from the Delphi research group at Carnegie Mellon University!
We’re a group of faculty, students, and staff, based primarily out of CMU
together with strong collaborators from other universities and industry.
Our group was founded in 2012 to advance research in epidemic forecasting.
Since March 2020, we have refocused efforts towards helping combat the COVID-19
pandemic, by supporting informed decision making at federal, state, and local
levels of government and in the healthcare sector. Until now, we’ve been pretty
“heads down” with our work, and slow to communicate what we’ve been up to.
But at last… Delphi finally has a blog!
This first post serves as an introduction of sorts.
Future posts will dive deeper into our various projects.&lt;/p&gt;

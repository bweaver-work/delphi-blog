# Blog posts we should write

## Medical Claims Indicators. Maria + Aaron + Roni
- Explain HSP signals
- Doctor visits signal, hospital admissions signal, give important details,
describe backfill issue and fix  
- Basic views of the data and potentially interesting preliminary results
- Do not describe Change Healthcare yet, but mention that we added a substantial
volume of new medical claims data (express sufficient enthusiasm) and say we
will report in a future post   

## COVIDcast Interactive Map. Adam + Jodi + Roni 
- Describe the map, basic how-to's
- Interesting things you can see from the map tool
- Interesting customer feedback / interactions?
- Here we can also take the time to introduce some of the remaining signals
that aren't (yet) "exciting enough" to warrant their own post, like Google
Search Trends, SafeGraph, etc.  

## covidcast R Package. Alex + Ryan 
- API access from within R.  Also describe Python side which is less developed
but still supports API access  
- Show off our cool plotting tools: choro maps, bubble maps, time series 
- Hopefully by this point we'll have more stuff to show off too, like basic
correlation functions, signal processing functions, etc. 

## Quantile Modeling: Forecast Scoring Rules and Ensembles. Ryan
- I have two notebooks, one on forecasting scoring rules, and ensembles
- Basically just sets up introduces the technical machinery needed to understand
forecasting and ensembling 
- This post might be a technical outlier compared to the others (which is OK) 

## Why is COVID-19 Forecasting Hard?  Larry + Rob (+ Ryan?)
- High-level, what are the things that make forecasting a hard problem in the
current pandemic?
- Back up with lots of examples, both instance-specific, and evaluation
- Gets us to ease into forecast evaluation without unloading all the details 

## Tutorial on Forecaster Evaluation.  Jacob (+ James or Alden?)
- Now unload all the details on evaluation.  This should be very important and
impactful 
- Basically go through a demo evaluation report comparing a bunch of models, and
first we should probably get the "OK" from the authors of those models
- We can also use this to preview the evalforecast package
- Can also include analysis from Jacob's mixed effects model 

## "Simple" Statistical Forecasts.  Larry + Rob (+ Ryan?)
- Explain the CMUDelphi-TimeSeries models, both county and state. 
- Position it very carefully. It is simple and more like a "smart straw man",
instead of "magic".    
- Want to wait until we've refactored the model so that we can have tried basic
improvements that were "left on the table" 
- Give basic overview, basic evaluation details, and our summary of its
strengths and weaknesses  

# Other potential ideas

## Hotspot detection with the COVIDcast indicators?  
## Insights from Change Healthcare data?
## Insights from full Facebook survey?
## Highlights of issue/lag and how it's critical to forecasting?

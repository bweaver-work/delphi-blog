1. Hello World. Roni + Ryan
- Introduction, mission statement, etc
- Explain that we've been up to a lot since we started the pandemic effort, but
haven't really documented it.  Next several posts are about this
- Also use this space to acknowledge our partners and sponsors 

*****
In every blog post that follows: describe credits carefully! That is, describe
who did what, for each part of what made the project-at-hand (topic of the blog
post) possible.  

As a subtitle, right at the top, make it visible. This will give the right group
members proper credit even if they didn't write the blog post

2. What We've Been Up To: "Simple" Statistical Forecasts.  Larry + Ryan 
- Explain the CMUDelphi-TimeSeries model. Position it very carefully. It is
simple and more like a "smart straw man", instead of "magic".  
- Give basic overview, basic evaluation details, and our summary of its
strengths and weaknesses 
- Long technical appendix of plots (or link to an external notebook?) 
- Preview the other forecasting ideas we're working on
- Preview the evaluation forecasting R package to come...

3. What We've Been Up To: Symptom Surveys. Ryan + ?
- Explain Facebook and Google survey setups, and signals. 
- For each, describe basic methodology, some basic views of the data and
potentially interesting preliminary results
- Describe the relationship between the two (wrt the community question?
- Preview the covidcast R package (to be developed further/explained in a later
post) 

4. What We've Been Up To: Medical Claims. Roni + ?
- Explain HSP signals
- Doctor visits signal, hospital admissions signal, give important details,
describe backfill issue and fix 
- Again, basic views of the data and potentially interesting preliminary results
- DO NOT describe Change Healthcare yet, but mention that we added a substantial
volume of new medical claims data (express sufficient enthusiasm) and say we
will report in a future post 

5. What We've Been Up To: COVIDcast Map. Jodi + Roni 
- Describe the map, basic how-to's
- Interesting things you can see from the map tool
- Here we can also take the time to basically describe the 
remaining signals that aren't "exciting enough" to warrant their
own post, like Google Search Trends, SafeGraph, etc.

6. What We've Been Up To: COVIDcast API.  Katie + Alex 
- Describe the API, tutorial for basic data access queries
- This post can be short but sweet 
- If suitable, can even show people how to construct a query string to pass to
covidcast.cmu.edu to get a custom map
- If suitable, can even discuss issue dates and their importance 

7. What We've Been Up To: `covidcast` R Package. Alex + Ryan 
- API access from within R.  Also describe Python side which is less developed
but still supports API access 
- Show off our cool plotting tools: choro maps, bubble maps, time series 
- Hopefully by this point we'll have more stuff to show off too, like basic
correlation functions, signal processing functions, etc.

Other blog posts that are pretty much ready to go, because we've already written
notebook on them.  Not numbered because I don't know where they should go: 

x. Thoughts on Forecast Scoring Rules. Ryan
- I already have a notebook written for this. Just a discussion of the weighted
interval score, which the CDC landed on for forecast scoring

x. Thoughts on Density vs Quantile Ensembles. Ryan
- Again, I already have a notebook written for this. Discussion of the
differences between stacking densities and stacking quantiles 

More things we should write about once we're ready to. Not numbered because I
don't know where they should go: 

x. Other forecasting models

x. Forecasting R package

x. Hot spot detection / early warning with the COVIDcast indicators

x. Insights from the full / expanded Facebook survey

x. Insights from Change Healthcare data

x. Highlights of our issue date/lag system and how it's useful for forecasters.
Illustrated with examples of backfill from our signals (like DV).
